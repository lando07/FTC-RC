/*
 * This OpMode executes an Omni Drive control TeleOp for a direct drive robot
 * The code is structured as an Iterative OpMode
 *
 *This particular OpMode illustrates driving a 4-motor Omni-Directional (or Holonomic) robot.
 * This code will work with either a Mecanum-Drive or an X-Drive train.
 * Both of these drives are illustrated at https://gm0.org/en/latest/docs/robot-design/drivetrains/holonomic.html
 * It raises and lowers the claw using the left and right triggers respectively.
 * It also opens and closes the claws slowly using the left and right dpad buttons.
 *
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this OpMode to the Driver Station OpMode list
