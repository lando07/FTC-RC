# FTC 24764 Robot Code

## Code conventions
The TeamCode module uses a subsystem/object-oriented conventions
All code for each part of the robot, such as the drivetrain, servos,
sliders each have their own class which are instantiated as objects in the main
TeleOp or Autonomous.

## History
Created and currently maintained by Lando07 in 2024 for FTC INTO THE DEEP, this repository now includes 
the code for FTC DECODE and the new robot. With a custom-built subsystem architecture both made and 
maintained by Lando07, it represents the most clear, concise, and well-documented code from him, and 
teaches naming conventions, good code design, and object-oriented programming to other apprentices 
on the team to create the best robot with the limited resources of the FTC Team 24764 which lead 
them to win UIL State Semi-Finalists in Division 5A for FTC Robotics. Lando07 is now a mentor of 
the team and is a Computer Engineering major at UT San Antonio in the Honors College.

Have Fun!
