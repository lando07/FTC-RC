 * This OpMode executes a Tank Drive control TeleOp a direct drive robot
 * The code is structured as an Iterative OpMode

 * In this mode, the left and right joysticks control the left and right motors respectively.
 * Pushing a joystick forward will make the attached motor drive forward.
 * It raises and lowers the claw using the Gamepad Y and A buttons respectively.
 * It also opens and closes the claws slowly using the left and right Bumper buttons.
